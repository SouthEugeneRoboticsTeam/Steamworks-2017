## Contributing

### Branches

The `master` branch of this repository should contain only well tested code.
The idea is that if we had to go to competition today, if we used code from
master it would behave predictably.

More major changes should be done in the `development` branch. All forks and
branches should come out of `development`.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, create a fork and a branch
named after the branch's purpose, limiting it to about 12 characters. For
example, if you are creating the intake subsystem, name your branch
`intake-sub`.

### Issues

If you're looking to fix an issue, assign yourself to that issue or have
someone assign you.

If you are a new team member, issues labeled
[`rookie`](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/Steamworks-2017/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arookie)
are a great way to get started!

When creating an issue that's specific to a branch (e.g., `intake-sub`), make
sure to label it with the name of that branch.

### Pull Requests

Make sure your code follows
[SERT's Style Guide](https://github.com/SouthEugeneRoboticsTeam/Guidelines)
before making a pull request to merge your changes.

Pull requests should be made to the `development` branch. Fully tested and
working code may later be squashed and merged into `master`.

Pull requests should be approved by at least one peer before being merged into
`master`. If you have extra time or are bored, review some PR's using GitHub's
[pull request review system](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/).
